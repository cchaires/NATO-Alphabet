# NATO-Alphabet

## Introduction
This code reads in a CSV file of NATO phonetic alphabet and creates a dictionary to map each letter of the alphabet to its corresponding phonetic code. The program also allows users to input a word and generate a list of the phonetic code words for each letter in the input word.

## Requirements
To run this program, you need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pandas module

## How to use
1. Download the "nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv" file and save it in the same directory as the Python script.
2. Run the Python script in a terminal or IDE.
3. Follow the instructions on the console. When prompted, enter a word and press Enter.
4. The program will output a list of the phonetic code words for each letter in the input word.

Note: Only letters in the alphabet are accepted. If a non-alphabetic character is entered, the program will display an error message and prompt the user to enter a new word.

## Example
Suppose the user inputs the word "hello". The program will output the following:
```
['Hotel', 'Echo', 'Lima', 'Lima', 'Oscar']
```
